Jarvis - Advanced Bilingual AI Assistant
1. Introduction
Jarvis is an advanced bilingual AI assistant designed for sophisticated interaction, robust long-term memory, internet-verified information accuracy, and high-performance operation. It is proficient in both English and Dutch, automatically detecting and responding in the user's language with natural fluency. Jarvis aims to emulate a helpful, friendly, and slightly witty personality, inspired by the AI from "Iron Man."

This project leverages local Large Language Models (LLMs) and a suite of modern AI and database technologies to provide a comprehensive and intelligent user experience.

2. Core Features
Bilingual Fluency (English/Dutch): Automatic language detection and natural, idiomatic responses in both English and Dutch.
Long-Term Memory (LTM):
Explicit Knowledge: Users can upload documents (PDFs, Markdown, etc.) via OpenWebUI to provide Jarvis with specific knowledge.
Implicit Conversational Memory: Jarvis automatically detects and stores salient information, user preferences, and summaries from conversations into semantic (vector) and relational (graph) databases.
Extended Context Window: Designed to handle and recall substantial amounts of information within ongoing conversations.
Internet-Verified Accuracy: Proactively verifies factual information using real-time internet searches, citing sources for transparency.
High Performance: Optimized for responsiveness and speed on specified server hardware (NVIDIA V100 GPUs).
Comprehensive Knowledge Domains: Expertise spanning technology, science, humanities, practical tasks, and local Belgian/Dutch context.
Defined Persona: Helpful, friendly, and slightly witty, with clear operational guidelines for information sourcing and interaction style.
Structured Responses: Provides clear, actionable answers, with options for detailed explanations, code snippets, and structured formatting.
3. Technology Stack
LLM Serving: Ollama (for serving local LLMs like Llama 3.1 8B Instruct)
User Interface & Explicit LTM: OpenWebUI
Backend Orchestration: Python with FastAPI and LangChain
Vector Database (Implicit Semantic LTM):(https://www.trychroma.com/)
Graph Database (Implicit Relational LTM): Neo4j
Internet Search:(https://tavily.com/) (or similar)
Containerization & Orchestration:(https://www.docker.com/) and Docker Compose
Language Detection: Python libraries like lingua-py or fastText.
Asynchronous Task Queue: Celery with Redis (or RabbitMQ)
4. System Architecture Overview
Jarvis consists of several interconnected services:

OpenWebUI: Provides the user interface and manages explicit user-provided knowledge.
Python Backend (FastAPI + LangChain): The central orchestrator. It handles:
User query processing and RAG pipeline execution.
Interaction with Ollama for LLM responses.
Reading from and writing to LTM databases (ChromaDB, Neo4j).
Invoking internet searches via Tavily.
Automatic LTM population from conversations (asynchronously).
Ollama Instances (x2): Serve the core Jarvis LLM, each running on a dedicated NVIDIA V100 GPU.
ChromaDB (Custom LTM): Stores implicit semantic memories (conversation embeddings, summaries).
Neo4j (Custom LTM): Stores implicit relational memories (entities, relationships from conversations).
Tavily API: External service for real-time internet searches.
(Optional) Nginx Load Balancer: Distributes requests to the Ollama instances.
All components are designed to run in Docker containers orchestrated by Docker Compose.

5. Hardware Requirements (Target Deployment)

6. Setup and Installation
6.1. Prerequisites
Docker Engine: Install on your Ubuntu 22.04 server.
Docker Compose: Install the Docker Compose plugin.
Git: For cloning this repository.
NVIDIA Drivers & CUDA Toolkit: Ensure appropriate NVIDIA drivers, CUDA Toolkit, and cuDNN are installed on the host system for GPU acceleration. Verify with nvidia-smi.
Tavily API Key: Obtain an API key from(https://tavily.com/).
6.2. Configuration Steps
**Clone the Repository:**bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>


Environment Configuration:

Copy the example environment file:
Bash

cp.env.example.env
Edit the .env file and fill in your specific configuration details:
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key
NEO4J_PASSWORD=your_secure_neo4j_password
OPENWEBUI_SECRET_KEY=generate_a_random_strong_secret
Other necessary API keys or configuration values.
Download LLM Model:

Download the chosen GGUF model file for Jarvis (e.g., llama-3.1-8b-instruct.Q5_K_M.gguf).
Place the GGUF file into the host directories that will be mounted into the Ollama containers. By default, these might be ./ollama_data_gpu0/models/ and ./ollama_data_gpu1/models/. Ensure the model file is accessible at a path like /root/.ollama/models/your_model_name.gguf inside the Ollama containers.
Prepare Ollama Modelfile:

Ensure the Jarvis.Modelfile (defining the Jarvis persona and parameters) is present in the project, typically in a location accessible to the Ollama containers (e.g., mounted into /opt/ollama_modelfiles/ inside the container).
6.3. Running the System
Build Custom Docker Images (if applicable):
If you've made changes to the Dockerfile for the Python backend or other custom components:

Bash

docker-compose build
Start All Services:
Launch all services defined in docker-compose.yml in detached mode:

Bash

docker-compose up -d
Create the Jarvis Model in Ollama:
Once the Ollama containers (ollama1, ollama2) are running, create the Jarvis model using its Modelfile. Execute this for each Ollama instance:

Bash

docker exec -it ollama1 ollama create jarvis -f /path/to/Jarvis.Modelfile_inside_container
docker exec -it ollama2 ollama create jarvis -f /path_to/Jarvis.Modelfile_inside_container
(Replace /path/to/Jarvis.Modelfile_inside_container with the actual path where the Modelfile is located inside the Ollama containers, e.g., /opt/ollama_modelfiles/Jarvis.Modelfile)

Verify Services:
Check the status of all running containers:

Bash

docker-compose ps
Inspect logs for any errors:

Bash

docker-compose logs -f <service_name> # e.g., python-backend, ollama1
6.4. Accessing Jarvis
Open your web browser and navigate to the OpenWebUI interface. This is typically http://<your_server_ip>:8080 (or the port configured in docker-compose.yml).
Complete the initial OpenWebUI setup (create an admin account if it's the first run).
In OpenWebUI, configure the connection to your Ollama instances (e.g., http://ollama_lb:11430 if using the load balancer, or http://ollama1:11434 and http://ollama2:11435 individually).
Select the "jarvis" model from the list of available models in OpenWebUI.
Start interacting with Jarvis!
7. Usage
Interact with Jarvis through the OpenWebUI chat interface. You can:

Ask questions in English or Dutch.
Provide documents for Jarvis to learn from via OpenWebUI's "Knowledge" feature.
Engage in technical discussions, creative tasks, or ask for practical assistance.
Expect Jarvis to remember key details from your conversation for context.
Look for source citations when Jarvis provides factual information.

# spacy
# nltk
**Note on `requirements.txt`:**
*   It's generally good practice to pin versions (e.g., `fastapi==0.100.0`) for reproducible builds, but I've omitted them here as they would be determined during active development.
*   Some libraries like `pydantic` or `httpx` might be pulled in as dependencies of `fastapi` or `langchain`, but explicitly listing them can be helpful.
*   The choice between `lingua-py` and `fasttext` for language detection, or `redis` vs `rabbitmq` for Celery, would be finalized during implementation. I've included common choices.

These files should provide a good starting point for your project documentation and de
